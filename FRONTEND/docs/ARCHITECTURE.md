# Software Architecture - StudySnap

This document details the modular folder structures, runtime data flow, and components hierarchy of the **StudySnap** application.

## 1. Directory Blueprint
- `app/` - Next.js App Router root layout, styles, global stylesheets, and API routes.
  - `api/` - Directory containing route handlers for database management and AI services.
  - `layout.tsx` - App envelope registering PWA scripts and Clerk authorization containers.
  - `page.tsx` - Single Page app tab controller.
- `components/` - Isolated client view widgets implementing Material Design 3 tokens.
  - `HomeScreen.tsx` - Note directory feeds, category tabs, and study streaks.
  - `NoteEditor.tsx` - Rich note canvas incorporating TTS/STT and PDF builders.
  - `VoiceNotes.tsx` - Media recorder capturing audio buffers alongside transcript summaries.
  - `AiHelper.tsx` - Interactive AI quiz cards, translators, and tutor chatbot.
  - `RevisionCalendar.tsx` - Repetition planner displaying revision histories.
  - `StudyMap.tsx` - Client Leaflet map showing study zones.
  - `PwaRegister.tsx` - Bootstrapping scripts for offline service workers.
- `lib/` - Code constants, databases, auth utilities, and store handlers.
  - `db/` - Drizzle schemas and client initializers.
  - `store/` - Zustand global state persistent configurations.
  - `auth.ts` - Clerk ID resolution with mock-mode compatibility.
- `public/` - Public assets including manifests, service worker cache codes, and vectors.

## 2. Dynamic Offline Synchronization Policy
1. **Local Mutations:** Every user transaction (adding a note, completing a revision quiz, renaming folders) is executed instantaneously on the Zustand store.
2. **Persistence Guarantee:** Zustand serializes the entire state tree to `localStorage` immediately. If the student closes the web app or loses connection, data is preserved.
3. **Optimistic Cloud Sync:** The client continuously listens to network connection changes (via PwaRegister status triggers). If online, debounced fetch operations push local changes to the `/api/` endpoints to sync Neon Cloud PostgreSQL.
4. **Resiliency Fallback:** If API synchronization fails due to service timeouts or DB offline states, the client fails silently, allowing study sessions to proceed offline.
